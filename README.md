Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
This repository is a day-by-day record of everything I learn as I progress from beginner to advanced Python.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo doesn't focus on textbook-style definitions or formal explanations. Instead, it’s filled with personal notes, practical code examples, and hands-on learning.

## 📅 Daily Progress

I'll be updating this repo regularly with what I learn each day — from basic syntax to advanced concepts.

## 🎯 Goal

To master Python by building a solid foundation, writing real code daily, and documenting everything along the way.
